# Anki Housekeeper

The Anki Housekeeper keeps your Anki collection neat and tidy.

You can configure it to:

    1) Tag your cards based on topic.

    2) Fix spelling and grammar mistakes (TODO).

    3) Format URLs into nice looking hyperlinks (TODO).

    4) Notify you of cards that violate the [Twenty rules of formulating knowledge][0].
       These cards are tagged and / or output to the console or a file (TODO).

## Installation

```bash
pip install ankeep
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to provide a ChatGPT API Token to make use of some features.
> You can do this by creating an environment variable called `OPENAI_API_KEY`
> whose value is your token.
